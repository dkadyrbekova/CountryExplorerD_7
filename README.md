🌍 Countries of the World – Android Application

Countries of the World is an educational mobile application developed in Java using Android Studio. The app provides users with detailed and structured information about countries from different regions of the world in a simple and user-friendly format.

The main purpose of this project is to combine education and technology by creating a convenient tool for learning geography. The application allows users to explore countries, learn interesting facts, and improve their knowledge in an interactive way.

The app includes a list of countries where each item contains key information such as the country’s name, flag, capital city, population, region, and a short description. Users can open a detailed screen to read more information about a selected country. The interface is designed according to Material Design principles to ensure a clean and modern user experience.

Additionally, the application may include features such as a favorites system, progress tracking, and a quiz section to test geographical knowledge. The quiz functionality helps users reinforce what they have learned in an engaging format.

From a technical perspective, the project is built using Java and follows modern Android development practices. The architecture is based on the MVVM pattern to ensure clean code structure and separation of concerns. The project may use components such as RecyclerView for displaying lists, Room Database for local data storage, and REST API or a mock server for retrieving country data.

This project was created to strengthen Android development skills, practice working with architectural patterns, implement data management, and design an intuitive mobile interface.

The application can be run by cloning the repository, opening the project in Android Studio, syncing Gradle, and launching it on an emulator or a physical Android device.
